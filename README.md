Python is useful in the following fields.

  - Backend development - Python / Java / Go / PHP
  - DevOps - Python/Shell/Ruby
  - Data Acquisition - Python / C++ / Java
  - Quantitative Trading - Python / C++ / R
  - Data Science - Python/R/Julia/Matlab
  - Machine Learning - Python / R / C++ / Julia
  - Automated testing - Python/Shell

As a Python developer, there are many employment fields that can be chosen according to personal preferences and career planning.

- Python back-end development engineer (server, cloud platform, data interface)
- Python operation and maintenance engineer (automated operation and maintenance, SRE, DevOps)
- Python data analyst (data analysis, business intelligence, digital operations)
- Python data mining engineer (machine learning, deep learning, algorithm expert)
- Python crawler engineer
- Python test engineer (automated testing, test development)

> **Description**: At present, **data analysis and data mining are very popular directions**, because both the Internet industry and traditional industries have accumulated a large amount of data, and all walks of life need data analysts from More commercial value is found in some data, so as to provide data support for enterprise decision-making. This is the so-called data-driven decision-making.

A few suggestions for beginners:

- Make English as your working language.
- Practice makes perfect.
- All experience comes from mistakes.
- Don't be one of the leeches.
- Either outstanding or out.

1. Software Process Model
    - Classic process model (waterfall model)
      - Feasibility analysis (research to be done or not), output "Feasibility Analysis Report".
      - Requirements analysis (research what to do), output "requirements specification" and product interface prototype.
      - Outline design and detailed design, output conceptual model diagram (ER diagram), physical model diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram, etc.
      - Coding/testing.
      - Go Live/Maintenance.

      The biggest disadvantage of the waterfall model is that it cannot embrace changes in requirements. The product can only be seen after the entire process is completed, and the morale of the team is low.
    - Agile Development (Scrum) - Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer - Sprint
      - The Backlog of the product (user stories, product prototypes).
      - Planning meeting (evaluation and budget).
      - Daily development (standup meetings, Pomodoro Technique, pair programming, test first, code refactoring...).
      - Fix bugs (problem description, steps to reproduce, testers, assignees).
      - release version.
      - Review meeting (Showcase, users need to participate).
      - Retrospective meeting (to make a summary of the current iteration cycle).

      > Supplement: Manifesto for Agile Software Development
      >
      > - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
      > - **Working software** over thorough documentation
      > - **Customer cooperation** over contract negotiation
      > - **Response Change** is higher than follow plan

      ![](./res/agile-scrum-sprint-cycle.png)

      > Roles: product owner (who decides what to do, who can make decisions on requirements), team leader (solves various problems, focuses on how to work better, and shields external influence on the development team), development team (project executives) , specifically developers and testers).

      > Preparation: business case and funding, contracts, vision, initial product requirements, initial launch plan, stake, team building.

      > Agile teams typically have 8-10 people.

      > Workload estimation: Quantify the development tasks, including prototype, Logo design, UI design, front-end development, etc., try to break down each task into the minimum task amount, the minimum task amount standard is that the working time should not exceed two days, and then estimate the overall project time. Post each task on the board, which is divided into three parts: to do (to be completed), in progress (in progress) and done (completed).

2. Formation of project team

    - Team composition and roles

      > Explanation: Thank you **Fu Xiangying** for helping me draw the following exquisite company organization chart.

      ![company_architecture](./res/company_architecture.png)

      ![](./res/pylint.png)

    - Some "conventions" in Python (please refer to ["Python Conventions - How to Write Pythonic Code"](Python Conventions.md))

    - Reasons that affect code readability:

      - Code with too few or no comments
      - Code breaks language best practices
      - Anti-pattern programming (spaghetti code, copy-paste programming, conceited programming, ...)

3. Introduction to team development tools
    - Version control: Git, Mercury
    - Defect management: [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org.cn/)
    - Agile closed-loop tools: [Zen Tao](https://www.zentao.net/), [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/features)
    - Continuous integration: [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)

    Please refer to ["Problems and Solutions for Team Project Development"](Day91-100/91.Problems and Solutions for Team Project Development.md).

##### Project topic selection and business understanding

1. Setting the scope of topic selection

    - CMS (client side): news aggregation website, Q&A/sharing community, movie review/book review website, etc.
    - MIS (client end + management end): KMS, KPI assessment system, HRS, CRM system, supply chain system, warehouse management system, etc.

    - App background (management terminal + data interface): second-hand transactions, newspapers and magazines, niche e-commerce, news information, tourism, social networking, reading, etc.
    - Other types: own industry background and work experience, and the business is easy to understand and control.

2. Requirements understanding, module division and task assignment

    - Requirement understanding: brainstorming and competitive product analysis.
    - Module division: draw a mind map (XMind), each module is a branch node, and each specific function is a leaf node (expressed in verbs), it is necessary to ensure that each leaf node cannot regenerate new nodes, and determine each The importance, priority and workload of leaf nodes.
    - Task assignment: The project leader assigns tasks to each team member according to the above indicators.

    ![](./res/requirements_by_xmind.png)

     ```

   - Use PowerDesigner to draw physical model diagrams.

     ![](./res/power-designer-pdm.png)

4. Use of uWSGI/Gunicorn and Nginx
    - Comparison of Gunicorn and uWSGI
      - For simple applications that don't require a lot of customization, Gunicorn is a good choice. The learning curve of uWSGI is much steeper than that of Gunicorn, and the default parameters of Gunicorn can already adapt to most applications.
      - uWSGI supports heterogeneous deployment.
      - Since Nginx itself supports uWSGI, Nginx and uWSGI are usually bundled and deployed online, and uWSGI is a fully functional and highly customized WSGI middleware.
      - In terms of performance, Gunicorn and uWSGI are actually comparable.
